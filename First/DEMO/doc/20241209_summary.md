# DEMO Project Summary - 2024-12-09

I have successfully created a Rust project called `DEMO` that contains both a binary project and a library project within a workspace.

## Project Structure

```
DEMO/
├── Cargo.toml          # Workspace configuration
├── src/
│   └── main.rs         # Binary project entry point
├── demo_lib/
│   ├── Cargo.toml      # Library project configuration
│   └── src/
│       └── lib.rs      # Library code
└── doc/
    └── 20241209_summary.md  # This summary file
```

## Key Features

1. **Workspace Setup**: Created a Cargo workspace with both binary and library projects as members
2. **Binary Project**: The main `DEMO` binary that uses the library functionality
3. **Library Project**: A `demo_lib` library with a simple `add` function and tests
4. **Integration**: The binary project successfully imports and uses the library

## Files Created/Modified

1. **DEMO/Cargo.toml**: Added workspace configuration and library dependency
2. **DEMO/src/main.rs**: Modified to use the library's `add` function
3. **DEMO/demo_lib/Cargo.toml**: Library project configuration
4. **DEMO/demo_lib/src/lib.rs**: Library implementation with tests

## Implementation Details

### Workspace Configuration

The main `Cargo.toml` file was configured as a workspace:

```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "demo_lib",
]
```

### Library Dependency

The binary project depends on the library using a path dependency:

```tomlbrary code
└── doc/
    └── 20241209_summary.md  # This summary file
```

## Key Features

1. **Workspace Setup**: Created a Cargo workspace with both binary and library projects as members
2. **Binary Project**: The main `DEMO` binary that uses the library functionality
3. **Library Project**: A `demo_lib` library with a simple `add` function and tests
4. **Integration**: The binary project successfully imports and uses the library

## Files Created/Modified

1. **DEMO/Cargo.toml**: Added workspace configuration and library dependency
2. **DEMO/src/main.rs**: Modified to use the library's `add` function
3. **DEMO/demo_lib/Cargo.toml**: Library project configuration
4. **DEMO/demo_lib/src/lib.rs**: Library implementation with tests

## Implementation Details

### Workspace Configuration

The main `Cargo.toml` file was configured as a workspace:

```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "demo_lib",
]
```

### Library Dependency

The binary project depends on the library using a path dep
[dependencies]
demo_lib = { path = "demo_lib" }
```

### Library Functionality

The library provides a simple addition function:

```rust
pub fn add(left: u64, right: u64) -> u64 {
    left + right
}
```

### Binary Usage

The main binary demonstrates using the library:

```rust
use demo_lib::add;

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    let result = add(5, 7);
    println!("5 + 7 = {}", result);
}
```

## Verification

- ✅ Project builds successfully with `cargo build --workspace`
- ✅ Binary runs and produces expected output: `Hello, world!` and `5 + 7 = 12`
- ✅ Library tests pass with `cargo test -p demo_lib`
- ✅ Workspace tests pass with `cargo test --workspace`
- ✅ Clean build and run works with `cargo clean && cargo build --workspace && cargo run`

## Commands Used

```bash
# Create the binary project
cargo new --bin DEMO

# Create the library project within the workspace
cargo new --lib demo_lib

# Build the entire workspace
cargo build --workspace

# Run the binary
cargo run

# Run all tests in the workspace
cargo test --workspace
```

The project demonstrates a proper Rust workspace setup with both binary and library components working together seamlessly.
